Short-term TODO list:

  * Replace .bat/.sh files with .py scripts.

  * Activity diagrams of the print process we have and the print process we want.

  * Fix naming chaos in the JSON-RPC API.

  * Delete old branches.

  * Win32 named pipe to replace TCP socket (Python implementation is in the 'next' branch; need C++ still)

  * Add an option to the slicer configuration to let people specify a custom profile.

  * Create the longer-term TODO list.
