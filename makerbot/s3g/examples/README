#Examples
A series of scripts that should allow users easy access to the makerbot_driver.

##How To Use Each Script
All scripts must be given commands using standard line parsing.  To see a list of all parameters, issue:

    python <name_of_script>.py --help

This will output all parameters you as a user can supply to execute these scripts.
